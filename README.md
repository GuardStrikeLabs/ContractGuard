ContractGuard is a testing platform for smart contracts. It mainly exploits symbolic execution and fuzzing techniques integrated with static and dynamic
analysis that have been proven effective for smart contracts testing. It has been systematically applied to a set of more than 50 thousand smart contracts. ContractGuard is
on average more than two orders of magnitudes faster than similar state-of-the-art tools. It also covers more branches and reveals many more vulnerabilities.
